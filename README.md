This repository features a PDF Q&amp;A Bot built with Streamlit and Langchain. Users can upload PDFs, process the text, and ask questions related to the content. The bot uses advanced techniques like text chunking and embeddings to retrieve relevant information and generate detailed answers using a language model (LLM).
